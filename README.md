# Nova

## About
<strong>Currently, nova is a work in progress and is not ready for use.</strong>

This is planned to be a programming language that will be developed over the course of my degree

Nova (Nova_Lang) is a programming language that is planned to be a compiled
language, with an initial focus on being general purpose.

I am planning to have this language be easy to use, be compliled but also
have a system similar to Haskell's `runhaskell` command, where you can test
your program without having to compile it.

Nova is planned to be statically typed
