## About
<strong>Currently, nova is a work in progress and is not ready for use.</strong>

This is planned to be a programming language that will be developed over the course of my degree

Nova (Nova_Lang) is planned to be a programming language that is a compiled language, 
with an initial focus on being general purpose, where it will be easy to use, be 
compiled but also have a system similar to Haskell's `runhaskell` command, where 
you can test your program without having to compile it. This means that the language
will have an interpreter developed first, then a compiler.

I am planning to use an approach where I implement a working feature, then return
to it later for optimisation and refactoring.

This is a personal project, and I am not planning to make this a commercial project.

The main branch is intended to be the most stable branch, a development branch will be 
created when a feature is being worked on.

<strong>Everything is subject to change, and I am open to suggestions.</strong>

## Pull Requests
